Hello! My name is Cole, and I’m currently studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. My favorite thing about this project is how it is both fun and educational, making the story of insulin’s discovery engaging for people of all ages. I hope that everyone who tries out our project walks away having learned something new in an interactive way!

Fun fact: I enjoy playing a variety of sports such as Hockey, Basketball, Tennis, and more!
