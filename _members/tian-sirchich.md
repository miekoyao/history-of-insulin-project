Hi, I’m Tian! I’m currently at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My favourite thing about this project is that it’s not purely computer science. It combines several fields, such as computer science, medicine, and engineering to create a uniquely fun and educational experience. It’s also been a great opportunity to learn new skills and try things I’ve never done before!

Fun fact: Outside of school, I enjoy doing aerial silks! (think Cirque du Soleil)
