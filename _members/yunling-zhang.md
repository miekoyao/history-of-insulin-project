Hi, this is Yunling, Iâ€™m currently studying at University of Toronto as a Computer Science student. My favourite thing about this project is that it combines ComSci with LifeSci, and it gives us the opportunity to manipulate hardwares, which is not so common for CS.

Fun fact: I love plants and I keep a ton of them.
