# History of Insulin: An Interactive Exhibit 

This is a capstone design project for the University of Toronto CSC490 course: Interactive Experiences with Physical Computing. Our team is comprised of Cole Wiltse, Mieko Yao, Tian Sirchich, and Yunling Zhang. For this project, we are working in collaboration with Dr. Paul Dietz, and Dr. Mace Rothenberg from the [Museum of Medicine and Biomedical Discovery](https://mmbd.org/).

Utilizing hardware, software, and design skills, we have created an educational exhibit on the discovery of insulin by Frederick Banting and Charles Best in 1921.
