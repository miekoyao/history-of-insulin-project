For each component of the exhibit, we created informative posters, instructional booklets, and audio voice overs for users to learn more in-depth knowledge about our exhibit. Below are some photos and breakdowns for all of the educational content that was part of our exhibit.

## Posters

For each station, we designed an informational poster to to give participants further detail and information behind the history of insulin and how it corresponds to the exhibit. To make our posters stand out and appeal to all ages, we also included some fun facts and interesting details hidden behind overhanging paper covers. By including these covers, we aimed to create a feeling of surprise whenever particpants would discover a new bit of information while also maintaining our project's theme of physical interaction.

## Instructional Booklets

For each station, we designed a small instructional booklet. The purpose of these were to give more detailed instructions on how to properly operate each of our stations while giving hints for some of our puzzles. We also took this as an opportunity to reinforce the idea of reinacting the experiments of Banting and Best by making these instructional booklets appear like handwritten journals from the past, further immersing the particpant in our exhibit.

## Audio Voice Overs

For each station, we created audio voice overs that would play as particpants would go through our exhibit, guiding them while also giving some hints and historical context. The characters speaking are Frederick Banting and Charles Best, voiced by our sponsor Dr. Mace Rothenburg and professor Dr. Paul Dietz respectively. Having the voices of Banting and Best help provide a story for our exhibit where they need your help discovering insulin, providing another layer of immersion to the overall experience. The above introductory audio clip is one of many recorded tracks that would play throughout our exhibit, walking participants through each of our stations.
